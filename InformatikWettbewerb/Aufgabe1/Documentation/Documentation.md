##Documentation
This File is for documenting our code and the changes we have applied to it. 

The setText class is used to read the text which is stored in a specific .txt-file. 
This is done with a BufferedReader and a FileReader. The content of this File is stored in a variable called input.
The While-function is used to itterate through each line of the file, until there is nothing left to read, 
after that the BufferedReader is closed.
