#### Instruction:
This is a short instruction on how to use this program and what is does.
### How it works:
This program works like this: <br>
You save your text, which you want to be checked as a .txt file.
The program takes your text and iterates through it and determines if there is an intersection or not. 
If there is intersection you will find a '$' -character in your text, this is the word, you must change in order 
to prevent an intersection. You can also change entire sentences.  
In case there is no intersection in your text, you do not need to change anything at all and there will not be any markings in your text.
In both cases, you will also be notified through your terminal if there is an intersection in your text or if not. <br>
### How to use:
You simply start this program and specify a absolute directory, where your original text is located at. <br> 
A absolute directory looks something like this: <br>
Windows: "C:\Users\User\Documents\file.txt" <br>
Linux: "/home/user/documents/file.txt" <br>
